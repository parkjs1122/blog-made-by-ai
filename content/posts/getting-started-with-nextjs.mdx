# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. With version 14 and the App Router, it's even better. Let's dive in!

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key benefits:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes** - Build your backend with Next.js
- **File-based Routing** - Simple and intuitive routing
- **Built-in Optimization** - Image, font, and script optimization

## Installation

Getting started is easy:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

Here's what a typical Next.js 14 project looks like:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── about/
│       └── page.tsx
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.js
```

## Creating Your First Page

Creating a page is as simple as creating a file:

```typescript
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our about page!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Server Components

Next.js 14 introduces React Server Components by default:

```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 with the App Router brings powerful features to React developers. Start building today!
